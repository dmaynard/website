              <p>
                I am writing this blog to record some of my memories of
                watching, and participating in, multiple computer revolutions.
                Augmenting Knowledge workers at SRI with Douglas Engelbart,
                Personal Computing at P.A.R.C., Computer entertainment at
                Electronic Arts, and Mobile Computing at Google, and Clous
                computing at Box. I will also use this blog to document my
                continuing journey of learning new software systems, and
                languages. I will blog about creating software art in
                retirement. I will document my experiments in self publishing
                software on the web. My first two retirement projects are
                reproducing the software game, "Worms?", as a single page
